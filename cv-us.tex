            \item \textbf{MEng} (\emph{In Progress})

\section*{Research and Academic Projects}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis with TESLA} Master's Research Project \\
      \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        \emph{November 2016--June 2017} & \emph{University of Cambridge}
      \end{tabular}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item TESLA is a framework for dynamic instrumentation of C programs
          using temporal logic assertions. As part of my Master's degree, I am
          conducting research into how static analysis can be used to extend the
          capabilities of this system.

        \item The primary research goal is to identify a useful subset of
          temporal logic assertions that can be proved at compile time, and to
          use this analysis to optimise instrumentation using TESLA.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{An Implementation of the $\pi$-Calculus} Undergraduate Final
      Project \\
        \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            \emph{October 2015--May 2016} & \emph{University of Cambridge}
        \end{tabular}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In my final undergraduate year, my major project and
              dissertation involved the development of a programming language
              and runtime environment based on the $\pi$-Calculus process
              algebra.

            \item The project included a bytecode compiler for a language of my
              own design, as well as a full scheduling virtual machine to
              execute the bytecode. Both the compiler and virtual machine were
              written in Scala.

            \item In undertaking this project I gained strong experience in the
              theory and practice of compiler implementation, as well as an
              understanding of the problems faced when building concurrent
              systems.

            \item The final project implementation and associated dissertation
              received a first-class grade.

        \end{tabular}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item While at GoCardless I worked with the company's core payments
            team to improve and develop their banking infrastructure and
            processes.
          \item Projects I was responsible for included adding new features to
            internal risk and compliance tools, upgrading legacy code to allow
            for infrastructure changes, and designing auditing methods for
            changes to payment processes.
          \item I also spent time as the team's first responder, dealing with
            problems and queries about banking processes from across the
            company.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Mobile Presales Intern} VNC Automotive \\
        \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            \emph{June--September 2015} & \emph{Cambridge, UK}
        \end{tabular}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item At RealVNC I was primarily responsible for prototyping an
              implementation of Apple's CarPlay in-car entertainment software.

            \item My role involved developing kernel drivers to support USB
              communication with the iPhone, as well as building the user-level
              CarPlay software itself.

            \item I was responsible for undertaking preliminary research into
              how CarPlay could be integrated into the company's existing in-car
              systems, as well as the development work involved in building a
              prototype.
        \end{itemize}

    
    \item \textbf{Mobile Development Intern} University of Cambridge, Mobile Systems Group \\
		\begin{tabular}{c|c}
            \emph{June 2014--April 2015} & \emph{Cambridge, UK}
		\end{tabular}
		\begin{itemize}

            \item I built a native iOS version of an existing Android
                application (\emph{EasyM}) for collecting survey response and
                sensor data from users who take part in research studies.

            \item As well as being of active use to researchers, my work also
                served to evaluate the potential of Swift and iOS as a platform
                for mobile sensing applications related to the work of the
                research group.

            \item My primary work was carried out during an internship from
                June--September 2014, with more work being carried out part time
                from then until April 2015. At the end of my internship period I
                presented on my work to a group of academics at a research group
                meeting.

		\begin{itemize}

            \item At PenPalWorld I created an iOS app for a an existing social
                networking site with over a million users. Creating the app also
                involved builing a custom web API to interface with the site's
                existing database.

            \item Throughout the project I worked closely with the owner
                and founder of PenPalWorld to produce a quality end product.

            \item On launch my app was used by approximately 150 unique users
                per day, and my responsibilities were expanded to include
                managing user satisfaction with the product.

        \end{tabular}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In my second year of university I took on the role of
              Webmaster for the Trinity Hall June Event 2015, the largest
              capacity event in Cambridge University's famous May Week (with
              2000 people attending the event).

            \item I was responsible for web development, as well as managing the
