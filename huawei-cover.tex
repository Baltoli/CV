\opening{Dear Sir / Madam,} 

I am a first year PhD student at the university of Edinburgh, in the Center for
Doctoral Training in Pervasive Parallelism. Having seen an advertisement for
internships at Huawei circulated by my supervisor, I became interested in the
compilers research internship track offered.

My primary interest in this internship comes from my desire to apply my academic
work in the area to a larger-scale, practical context. I have a strong academic
track record in compilers, having undertaken work in the area during each stage
of my career so far (undergraduate, Master's and now PhD). Additionally, I have
several years of practical software development experience in a number of
different contexts, working with both large and small teams to deliver effective
products---combined with my research experience, I believe that I would be a
good fit for this position. With regard to the particular requirements listed, I
have extensive C++ experience (including modern template metaprogramming
techniques), and have worked on multiple projects using the LLVM compiler
infrastructure.

I look forward to hearing more about the role and moving forward with the
application process.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
