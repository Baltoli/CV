\opening{Dear Sir / Madam,} 

I am currently a final-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh in the
UK. My completion date is anticipated to be September 2021, and I will be
looking to begin a full-time position at that time. The compiler and CodeQL team
at GitHub was recommended to me by a former colleague and collaborator from my
academic group, and I believe it would be an excellent fit for my interests and
skills.

My academic career has focused on compiler-centric analyses and techniques,
at the intersection of programming language theory and systems software, with a
track record of publication in high-quality conference venues (my r\'esum\'e
provides further details). Additionally, I have several years of practical
software experience in a number of different contexts, including substantial
recent work on a production compiler and its associated developer tooling. I
believe that this practical experience, combined with my exposure to
cutting-edge compilers research would make me a good fit for this position.

I am currently located in the UK, and have a strong interest in working as part
of a remote or distributed team. I look forward to hearing from you regarding
the next stage of the application process---I have good availability for a call
or other correspondence over the coming weeks.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
