\section{RESEARCH}

\par
\textbf{Heterogenous Compilation}\\
Compilation for parallel and heterogenous architectures, with a focus on how
legacy and future code can be automatically and transparently targeted to
emerging libraries and devices. Performance analysis and modelling of
competing library implementations for scientific code.

\par
\textbf{Program Synthesis}\\
Understanding and modelling the behaviour of black-box interfaces, and using
synthesized programs in novel applications of similar-program search.
Development of new algorithms and tools for synthesizing and JIT-compiling
imperative programs.

\par
\textbf{Verification}\\
Static analysis and model checking for runtime assertion systems in C programs,
aiming to improve the performance of compiler instrumentation. Development of
profiling and analysis tools for TESLA, a runtime assertion language implemented
as a compiler extension.

\section{PUBLICATIONS}

\textbf{Augmenting Type Signatures for Program Synthesis}\\

% \par
% \textbf{Program Synthesis}: I am interested in how program synthesis can be
% applied to learn behavioural models of libraries and hardware devices, using
% novel sources of information to efficiently navigate large solution search spaces.

% \par
% \textbf{Heterogenous Compilation}: My current research deals with new
% compilation models for heterogenous architectures, investigating how compiler
% developers and hardware vendors can cooperate to better optimise new and legacy
% code for the next generation of devices.

% \par
% \textbf{TESLA}: I investigated the use of static model checking techniques in the TESLA runtime
% temporal assertion system, demonstrating significant performance improvements on
% real instrumented code by optimising statically provable assertions.
